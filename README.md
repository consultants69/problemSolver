### DEV INNOVATION PROBLEM 2 (RANDOM USER DATA GENERATOR)
- Develop a web app that generates random user data(dummy data) and stores it in CSV file.

## Solution for the Web App
- Using Flask to build the Web Application. Flask is a micro-framework, so less dependencies.

- Using Pandas and StringIO library to get the CSV data.
- Using Flask inbuilt method to download the "userdata.csv" file.

 ## Solution for UI
 - Using Fomantic UI to create responsive components.
