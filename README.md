### DEV INNOVATION PROBLEM 2 (RANDOM USER DATA GENERATOR)
```
Develop a web app that generates random user data(dummy data) and stores it in CSV file.
```

## Solution for the Web App
```
- Using Flask to build the Web Application. Flask is a micro-framework, so less dependencies.
- All the parameters are stored in a text file and we choose a specific amount of them depending on the given slider range.
- Using Pandas and StringIO library to get the CSV data.
- Using Flask inbuilt method to download the "userdata.csv" file.
```

## Solution for the Deployment
```
- Using render to deploy the Flask application
- Configuring the environment and deploying the application
- Due to free plan the server gets spooled down, leading to few seconds of delay when opening the link back again.

## Solution for UI
```
 - Using Fomantic UI to create responsive components.
 - Making it customizable so the user can choose whichever parameter they want.
 - Using Jquery to add some functionality.
